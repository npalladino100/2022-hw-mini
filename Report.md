I changed the code to make the LED blink instead of fading.  I deleted everything except the #include directives, and wrote my own program that turns on the LED, sleeps for half a second, and then turns off the LED, repeating forever.  The program ran just fine.

The original program uses pulse-width modulation to change the brightness of the LED, and scales the modulated output signal to create a linear sweep in brightness.  I wanted to write my own program from scratch, so I deleted the entire program except for the headers and wrote my own simple program to blink the LED.  I used a similar Arduino program as a reference for the basic loop, and the pwm program as a reference for writing to the GPIO pins.  I had trouble writing programs to the raspberry pi at first.  I was geting errors when compiling, but I was eventually able to resolve it by installing a different version of arm-none-eabi-gcc on my system.  I ran both programs successfully and didn't run into any other issues.
